The Giraffe Family 
Julian and Stephanie Fenessy are giraffe experts. They live in Namibia in Africa with their son, Luca, and daughter, Molly. They aren’t from Namibia. They live there because of the giraffes. 
We help our parents with the giraffes. We use photos to see which giraffes are there. We know many giraffes because they all have different spots. Our family is from different places--my dad is from Australia, and my mom is from Germany.  
Giraffes are cool. They are tall and their colors are beautiful. I like their soft noses. Melvin is the name of my favorite giraffe. I like living here, but we don’t see our grandparents, uncles and aunts, or cousins in Germany and Australia very often.

 2 Where are the children in the photo? Listen and read. 

For some children it isn’t easy to get to school. In big cities it is dangerous because there are lots of cars. In Caracas, Venezuela some children don’t travel through the city; they travel above the city in cable cars. In Tokyo, many Japanese children travel under the city on the subway. In some cities, like Rouen, France there are “bike buses,” bicycles for many people that ride around the city so that the children go to school together. It’s good exercise! 
And then there are children who walk a long way to get to school. Radhika and Yashoda live in the village of Syaba in the Himalayas, In India. They walk all the way down the mountain. They walk along a little path through the forest. Then they go across the river on a special cable car. It takes two hours!

The Greatest Artist in the World 
Zheng is a famous artist in China. People come from everywhere to see his paintings. Zheng is proud of his paintings—maybe too proud. He thinks he’s the best artist who ever lived.  
One day, Zheng hears that the Emperor wants a new portrait of himself. So, Zheng goes to the palace to show the Emperor his paintings. Many other artists are there, but Zheng is sure that the Emperor will like his paintings the best. But when he shows them to the Emperor’s advisor, the advisor just laughs.        
“Go to the Li River,” says the advisor. “The greatest artist in the world lives there. You can learn a lot from her.” 
Zheng is very angry, but he packs his bags and travels to the Li River. He arrives at a village and asks a woman, “Where does the great artist live?” The woman smiles and points to the river. 
The next morning, Zheng takes a boat and starts his journey to find the greatest artist in the world. The small boat travels quietly down the river, past forests, mountains, and waterfalls. Then, as evening comes, the sky and water turn a beautiful blue color. It is so beautiful that Zheng begins to cry. And then he understands: the greatest artist in the world is Nature.
